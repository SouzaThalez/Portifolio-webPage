# Introduction

With this project i wanted to create a personal website, just to have a place where i could post, create and share all of my content in one place. 
So this is a personal website portfolio.

## Technologies used

Vanila JavaScript CSS and SCSS.

## Features and functionality 

Personal website for content display.It has three main pages:
* Works - Completed personal projects page. Here a list all of my completed projects
* Sources - Main tecnologies learned. Here i list all of the libraries, laguages and frameworks i have worked with.
* About - Brief information about me and my hobbies.

## Learning process 

The learning process for this project was impactful! This one was my first personal website and I didn't have much knowledge of mockups and design concepts yet. 
I struggle with positioning images inside grid content, but once you learn how grid structures work, everything starts to make more sense
